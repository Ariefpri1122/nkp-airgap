# Virtual Machine for PostgreSQL NDB

when installing postgresql error python:

```markdown
You have to enable "Oracle Linux 9 CodeReady Builder (x86_64) - (Unsupported)" repository in /etc/yum.repos.d/oracle-linux-ol9.repo , as it is disabled by default.

Then `postgresql15-devel` installs as expected.
